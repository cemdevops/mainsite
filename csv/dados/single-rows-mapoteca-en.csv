1|Dataset from Social Dimensions of Inequality (PDSD)|No Cartographic|Work and Income|IBGE|"The research The Social Dimensions of Inequality (PDSD) is a unique initiative within the Brazilian social sciences. The research stems from the Project for Stratification and Social Mobility Indicators, coordinated by the researcher Nelson do Valle Silva (IESP-UERJ), with CNPQ funding, and who conducted fieldwork throughout Brazil producing a (random) sample with national representation – and with a design comparable to the current National Research Sampling (PNAD-IBGE) until 2004 (i.e. only the rural areas of the North have not been researched).

The idea was to produce a consistent set of sociological indicators for monitoring the dynamics of inequality and social mobility in Brazil. In this sense, the research is wholly unique; and such purpose was fulfilled with thoroughness, depth, and mastery. Official researches conducted by government agencies commonly focus solely on the most basic population attributes and categorizations, often neglecting central issues for the social sciences. The PDSD is extensively rich and detailed, aiming to fill the informational gap on many topics of interest. One of its main motivations was to investigate the process behind the creation and transmission of inequality throughout the life cycle of individuals, identifying crucial moments and landmarks."|Data table|Pesquisa_Dimensoes_Sociais_da_Desigualdade.rar|2004|01/05/2009

The third bank also includes the geo-referenced data of the bicycle stands of the municipality of São Paulo and aims to provide complementary information to the CEM dataset. It provides information on 84 equipment where it is possible to store bicycles, as to their location, type (bicycle or paracycle), number of places available for bicycles and institution linked to the transport responsible for their maintenance (SPTrans, CPTM, Metrô, ViaQuatro, EMTU , SPPI or SPSE).|Cycling routes|Ciclovias_2017_CEM_V2.zip|2017|01/06/2017

Based on data obtained through SPTrans's information access law and its website, the dataset is an important resource for researchers dedicated to urban studies to understand the dynamics of production of bus services, an object still Social sciences. By systematizing the characteristics of the network of lines, it facilitates the extension of the possibilities of analysis of urban mobility, generally focused on questions of travel time, modalities of transport and use of the road."|Bus lines|LB15_MSP_CEM_V3.zip|2015|01/09/2015

The study coordinated for Sehab / PMSP was accomplished in two phases: 1) correctness and repair of existing cartographies of slums and settlements in order to enable the production of statistics (without cadastral purposes) and 2) estimates of households (and people) in favelas and clandestine and irregular settlements of low income (average income of the person responsible for less than 3 minimum wage) and social characterization of the residents and their social conditions.

In addition to representing the city's road infrastructure, allowing to infer the location of squares, parks, hydrographic channels, as well as perceiving the different plots of urban design, is the quintessential localization and geocoding tool of specific phenomena - people, events, equipment, etc. The 2018 edition totals 326,004 segments (each stretch of road - from corner to corner), of which 89% have name, real estate numbering and postal code (ZIP code). This number is quite significant, if we take into account the exceptional dynamics of metropolitan urban space. Even with the tendency towards densification and stabilization to the detriment of the expansion of the urban fabric, RMSP still incorporates a large volume of changes: new settlements, residential implants, condominiums, roadways and urban transport, large equipment, etc. which determine important impacts in the diverse cartographies, the geometric representation or the attributes. Since 2014, the CEM base of farms has incorporated a large number of changes. More than 43 thousand segments - 13% of the total - were altered or incorporated in the current edition. The changes refer to the drawing or layout, technically called GEOMETRY or the data referring to each segment, called ATTRIBUTES. The layout of the roads (roads, avenues, highways, viaducts, etc.) can be reallocated for a more precise positioning, as well as new segments. The attributes can also be adjusted or complemented: path name, zip code, real estate numbering, district to which it belongs, etc.|Public place|LOG2018_CEM_RMSP.zip|2018|01/01/2018

The original data was received in tabular database format. These databases were then standardized and georeferenced by the CEM Technology Transfer Team. Georeferencing consists of assigning geographic coordinates to each tabular database record, through operations performed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. This process uses the geo-referenced CEM site base that, in a GIS environment, performs the binding of addresses to a geographic coordinate system, expressed generally in latitude and longitude. This database was used in the Schools application, specially formulated for the general public, where information about the performance and operating conditions of public schools in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region is obtained.

The geographical conception of hydrography recognizes two basic types of phenomena on continental surfaces: watercourses (rivers, streams, channels) and bodies of water (lakes and reservoirs). In geoprocessing, water courses are usually linear phenomena, whereas water bodies are polygons (areas). The identification of hydrographic EMF files indicates this condition: HidrL (L = line), where are the rivers, and HydrA (A = area), where are the reservoirs."|"
